### Choosing the developer role

Here i would like to show you common developer types/roles every big project usualy has [stackoverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#developer-profile-_-developer-type) I strongly advice you to take a look at other sections in this survey

> If it will be interested i can create sections here for some of them. But keep in mind what for this moment i'm gonna stick with Front-end and Back-end materials or you can call it Full Stack as well.

### Choosing Editor \(IDE - Integrated development environment\)

Every developer should write code somewhere. For this purpose there are different editors, even online. You can choose any based on the programming languages you use and your personal feelings. You can also check the most trending [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-popular-development-environments)

> I recommend to use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

In case you want to share your code with someone you can use [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io)
